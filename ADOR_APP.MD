## Project Description :page_facing_up: 

Please provide the following:
  * We are building an agnostic hub for education, identity & virtual items.

  * We take a unique approach where we aim to connect the best tech (like polkadot) and present it to thousands of crypto experts & newbies alike.
  * Mass adoption & financial equality is the mission. We are partnering with Colleges, galleries and institutions currently. As we build our MvP we will be able to fully show our vision.
